## 💡 Languages I code in

👨🏻‍💻 **Python**
👨🏻‍💻 **Javascript**
👨🏻‍💻 **SQL**
👨🏻‍💻 **VBA**

I started with **VBA** as my first programming language, and later, I delved into **JavaScript** and **SQL** with a focus on both **frontend** and **backend** development. It's been some time, but I still retain some knowledge from those experiences. Currently, I've been immersing myself in **Python** and **SQL** for the field of **data science**!

## 📚 About This Project

This is a very simple study project focused on clustering.

### ✒️ Dataset Name
Customer Clustering

### 📝 About Dataset
"Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.

You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. You want to understand the customers like who are the target customers so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly."
