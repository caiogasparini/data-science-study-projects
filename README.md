## 💡 Languages I code in

👨🏻‍💻 **Python**
👨🏻‍💻 **Javascript**
👨🏻‍💻 **SQL**
👨🏻‍💻 **VBA**

I started with **VBA** as my first programming language, and later, I delved into **JavaScript** and **SQL** with a focus on both **frontend** and **backend** development. It's been some time, but I still retain some knowledge from those experiences. Currently, I've been immersing myself in **Python** and **SQL** for the field of **data science**!

## 📚 About This Repository

I've established this repository to **store and share all my data science projects**. Initially, the folders are categorized into **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. As the need arises, I can create new folders for other types of machine learning or even data analysis. Each project contains a **README.md** file with detailed information about the project, including the folder structure and the files.
