## 💡 Languages I code in

👨🏻‍💻 **Python**
👨🏻‍💻 **Javascript**
👨🏻‍💻 **SQL**
👨🏻‍💻 **VBA**

I started with **VBA** as my first programming language, and later, I delved into **JavaScript** and **SQL** with a focus on both **frontend** and **backend** development. It's been some time, but I still retain some knowledge from those experiences. Currently, I've been immersing myself in **Python** and **SQL** for the field of **data science**!
## 📚 About This Project

This is a very simple study project focused on regression.

### ✒️ Dataset Name
Students Exam Scores: Extended Dataset

### 📝 About Dataset
"This dataset includes scores from three test scores of students at a (fictional) public school and a variety of personal and socio-economic factors that may have interaction effects upon them.

Remark/warning/disclaimer:

This datasets are fictional and should be used for educational purposes only.
The original dataset generator creator is Mr. Royce Kimmons
There are similar datasets on kaggle already but this one is different and arguably better in two ways.
-> 1) has more data (>30k instead of just the 1k the other datasets have),
-> 2) has extended datasets with more features (15 instead of 9) and has missing values which makes it ideal for data cleaning and data preprocessing."
