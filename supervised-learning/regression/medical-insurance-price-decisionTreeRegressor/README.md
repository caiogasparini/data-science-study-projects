## 💡 Languages I code in

👨🏻‍💻 **Python**
👨🏻‍💻 **Javascript**
👨🏻‍💻 **SQL**
👨🏻‍💻 **VBA**

I started with **VBA** as my first programming language, and later, I delved into **JavaScript** and **SQL** with a focus on both **frontend** and **backend** development. It's been some time, but I still retain some knowledge from those experiences. Currently, I've been immersing myself in **Python** and **SQL** for the field of **data science**!
## 📚 About This Project

This is a very simple study project focused on regression.

### ✒️ Dataset Name
