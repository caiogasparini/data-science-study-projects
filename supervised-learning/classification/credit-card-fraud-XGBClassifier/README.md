## 💡 Languages I code in

👨🏻‍💻 **Python**
👨🏻‍💻 **Javascript**
👨🏻‍💻 **SQL**
👨🏻‍💻 **VBA**

I started with **VBA** as my first programming language, and later, I delved into **JavaScript** and **SQL** with a focus on both **frontend** and **backend** development. It's been some time, but I still retain some knowledge from those experiences. Currently, I've been immersing myself in **Python** and **SQL** for the field of **data science**!
## 📚 About This Project

This is a very simple study project focused on classification.

### ✒️ Dataset Name
Binary Classification with a Tabular Credit Card Fraud Dataset

### 📝 About Dataset
"The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Note, this base dataset for this competition was much larger than previous Tabular Tuesdays datasets, and thus may contain more artifacts than the last three competitions."
